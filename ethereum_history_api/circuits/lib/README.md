# Noir circuit

## Compilation

To compile circuit files and install dependencies run:

```sh
nargo compile --workspace
```
(or run `nargo compile --package package_name` to compile a single package)

## Generating proofs

This circuit uses oracles and therefore you need to run the oracle server before generating proofs.
Oracle server is located in [packages/noir-ethereum-api](../packages/noir-ethereum-api) and can be run by:

```sh
yarn oracle-server
```

After that you can generate proofs by running nargo with `--oracle-resolver` arg:

```sh
nargo prove --oracle-resolver http://localhost:5555
```

More details [here](https://noir-lang.org/docs/how_to/how-to-oracles/#step-3---usage-with-nargo)

## Generating verifiers

To generate a Solidity verifier for a package run:

```sh
nargo codegen-verifier --package package_name
``` 
(try `package_name=get_account`).

Be aware that this step may take several minutes when run for the first time. It is not recommended to use VSCode terminal for this command as it seems to run slowly.

After you generated a verifier (`contract/package_name/plonk_vk.sol`) you're ready to use its `verify` function to verify proofs.

## Testing

To test Noir circuit files run:

```sh
nargo test
```

## Known issues

### Private arguments

For now JS proover returns publicInputs including private arguments which causes an issue when we try to verify the proof using autogenerated contract. This should be investigated further but for now we just mark all arguments as public.
